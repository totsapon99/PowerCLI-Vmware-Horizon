# target refers to the vCenter username and address/hostname and the ESXi host for deployment

# In this example, the vCenter username is administrator@vsphere.local

# vSphere Network names. For pre 3.3 UAG versions, a vSphere Network Protocol Profile (NPP) must be associated with every referenced network name. This specifies
# network settings such as IPv4 subnet mask, gateway etc. UAG 3.3 and newer no longer uses NPPs and so for static IPv4 addresses a netmask0, netmask1 and netmask2
# value must be specified for each NIC. Normally a defaultGateway setting is also required.

# From UAG 3.0 and newer, you can specify the name of a .pfx or .12 format certificate file containing the required certificate and private key and
# any required intermediate certificates. In this case there is no need to use openssl commands to convert the .pfx/.p12 file into the
# associated PEM certificates file and PEM private key file.
#

pfxCerts=cert.pfx

#
# If there are multiple SSL certificates with private key in the .pfx file you also need to specify an alias name in order to select the required certificate.
# This is not necessary if there is only one SSL certificate with private key in the file
#

#pfxCertAlias=alias1

#
# The following pemCerts and pemPrivKey settings are only needed if you don't have a .pfx/.p12 file and want to directly use the two PEM format files.

#
# pemCerts refers to a PEM format file containing the SSL server certificate to be deployed. The file should also contain any
# required intermediate CA and root CA certificates.
#

#pemCerts=sslcerts.pem

#
# pemPrivKey refers to a file containing the RSA PRIVATE KEY for the SSL server certificate in the above certificate file.
#

#pemPrivKey=sslcertrsakey.pem

#
# From UAG 3.2 and newer, you can specify a certificate for the admin interface on port 9443. It is in the same format as [SSLCert] above.

# proxyDestinationUrl refers to the backend Connection Server to which this UAG appliance will connect.

#
# proxyDestinationUrlThumbprints only needs to be specified if the backend Connection Servers do not have

# The following external URLs are used by Horizon Clients to establish tunnel, HTML Access and PCoIP connections
